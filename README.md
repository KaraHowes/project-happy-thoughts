# Happy Thoughts


I made a Happy Thoughts App,which allows the user to post a Happy Thought - which must exceed 5 characters in length, but not exceed 140 characters, 

## The problem

I used JS React (useEffect, useState and Props) to fetch AND post data to an API built by Technigo. The new thought is displayed in a list and the user can 'like' a message by clicking on a heart-button.
